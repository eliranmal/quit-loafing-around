## notes

- this dough is very wet (which is why folding is used here), so make sure to coat it with plenty of flour before final proofing.
- moka is prepared with a macchinetta. if you don't have one, a strong americano, filter dripp or french-press coffee will all do just as well here. and if you don't have any of those, well, what are you doing here looking for coffee-bread?
