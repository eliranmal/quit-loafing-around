<p>
    there are some common steps involved in the making of any bread, and each is as important as the next.<br/>
    here’s the general algorithm:
</p>

<dl>
    <dt><br/><strong>1. scaling</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        mise en place.
        <br/>
        <em><sub>measure everything by weight (not volume), for accuracy.</sub></em>
    </dd>
    <dt><br/><strong>2. mixing, autolyse, kneading</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        mix the ingredients, put to rest to hydrate the flours (optional), then knead it.
        <br/>
        <em><sub>note: fats go in last.</sub></em>
    </dd>
    <dt><br/><strong>3. bulk fermentation</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        leave covered for initial proofing.
        <br/>
        <em><sub>until the dough nearly doubles in size.</sub></em>
    </dd>
    <dt><br/><strong>4. folding (&ldquo;punching&rdquo;)</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        fold the dough several times, then back to proofing. can be repeated couple of more times.
        <br/>
        <em><sub>this helps in strengthening the gluten net. also, no need to really punch your dough,
            ok?</sub></em>
    </dd>
    <dt><br/><strong>5. dividing</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        if you’re making more than one loaf, or lots of buns / rolls / bagels.
        <br/>
        <em><sub>use a scale to weigh every piece.</sub></em>
    </dd>
    <dt><br/><strong>6. pre-shaping</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        fold the dough to shape.
        <br/>
        <em><sub>the technique can change according to the desired loaf type.</sub></em>
    </dd>
    <dt><br/><strong>7. benching</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        leave the shaped dough to rest on the bench.
        <br/>
        <em><sub>to proof some more, and to relax the gluten net.</sub></em>
    </dd>
    <dt><br/><strong>8. final shaping (“panning”)</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        fold the dough to shape again, and put it in the pan (or on the peel).
    </dd>
    <dt><br/><strong>9. final proofing</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        leave to proof in the pan.
        <br/>
        <em><sub>until the spring test passes.</sub></em>
    </dd>
    <dt><br/><strong>10. scoring</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        coat with flour, or glaze with some liquid and cover with seeds, and score the bread as necessary.
        <br/>
        <em><sub>score depth depends on dough hydration, but the shape is up to you :)</sub></em>
    </dd>
    <dt><br/><strong>11. baking</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        place it in the center of a pre-heated fan oven.
        <br/>
        <em><sub>generally, yeast breads will bake at mid-high temperatures, and sourdough breads at high. some
            breads will benefit from a short initial high-temperature phase (e.g. GF ones).</sub></em>
    </dd>
    <dt><br/><strong>12. cooling</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        take the bread out of the pan, and leave it to cool on a cooling rack.
        <br/>
        <em><sub>this is actually post-baking and de-hydration, and can take anywhere between an hour to an entire
            day.</sub></em>
    </dd>
</dl>
