    <strong>mixing methods</strong> are different kinds of procedures used by bakers in the <em>mixing</em> step of the <a href="/steps-in-breadmaking">bread making process</a>.
</p>
<p>
    here are some of the ones used here:
</p>
<dl>
    <dt><br/><strong>straight dough</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        <ol>
            <li>mix the liquids, sugars, yeast and flours (in that order)</li>
            <li>knead for about 5 minutes</li>
            <li>add fats and salt</li>
            <li>knead for another 3 minutes</li>
            <li>add any chuncked extras (nuts, raisins, cubed veggies etc.)</li>
            <li>knead until they're evenly incorporated</li>
        </ol>
    </dd>
    <dt><br/><strong>sponge n&rsquo; dough</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        <ol>
            <li>mix some of the flour, water and yeast. some recipes also include sugars, salts, or milk (solids)</li>
            <li>cover and set to rest until the dough starts to deflate (decrements in height)</li>
            <li>add the rest of the ingredients, mix and knead</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            here's a generic sponge formula:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>65</strong> flours</li>
            <li><strong>2</strong> active dry yeast</li>
            <li><strong>50</strong> water (or milk)</li>
        </ul>
        <em><sub>all quantities should be reduced from the main formula</sub></em>
    </dd>
    <dt><br/><strong>folding</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        <ol>
            <li>mix all ingredients</li>
            <li>cover and set to rest for 10 minutes</li>
            <li>fold the dough by lifting a corner and pulling it towards the center, repeat 15-20 times</li>
            <li>repeat steps 2-3 two more times</li>
        </ol>
        <em><sub>look, mommy, no kneading!</sub></em>
    </dd>
</dl>
