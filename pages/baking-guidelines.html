<p>
    things to mind when getting to the actual <em>baking</em>:
</p>

<dl>
    <dt><br/><strong>bake time</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        bake times are always estimated.
        <br/>
        as general rule of thumb (and unless stated otherwise), the bread is ready when the bottom crust is crisp and hard, and knocking on it produces a hollow sound.
        <br/>
        <br/><em><sub>if you have a spike thermometer, check that the loaf center had reached its target temperature; at least 92°C for white yeast breads, higher for sourdough breads or wetter doughs, and up to 108-112°C for more battery, high-hydration, types of bread (e.g. GF breads).</sub></em>
    </dd>
    <dt><br/><strong>oven setup</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        preheat the oven for at least half an hour. use the oven fan function; it distributes heat better, and helps with evaporation.
        <br/>
        <em><sub>use an oven thermometer, if you have one, for better accuracy.</sub></em>
    </dd>
    <dt><br/><strong>pan prep</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        line the pan with baking paper, or grease it (messier).
        <br/>
        here's how i make my <a href="#">custom-fit lining templates</a>, which make the job so much easier.
    </dd>
    <dt><br/><strong>placement</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        make sure to position the loaf in the center of the oven.
        <br/>
        <em><sub>if your oven has uneven heat distribution, rotate the pan during bake.</sub></em>
    </dd>
    <dt><br/><strong>humidity</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        before turning on the oven, place a second pan at the bottom of the oven, filled with some water.
        <br/>
        alternatively, during bake, use a spray bottle to spray water into the oven space and onto the side walls.
        <br/>
        <em><sub>make sure to turn the oven fan off before opening the door!</sub></em>
    </dd>
